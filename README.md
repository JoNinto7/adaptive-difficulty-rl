# adaptive-difficulty-rl
This project implements and evaluates a reinforcement learning (RL) agent using SARSA to perform Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in a turn-based battle game. The work reproduces and extends concepts from Pagalyte et al., "Go with the Flow: Reinforcement Learning in Turn-Based Battle Video Games" (IVA 2020).
